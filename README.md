# Minecraft-Mod

This is a custom Minecraft mod for the 1.20.1 version of Java Minecraft. This is entirely a personal project meant to give me an introduction to both Java programming and Game development. The general idea of this mod is to create a variety of different new blocks and items, building upon the generic items already present within the game. Later on, the plan is to build fully customized items and NPCs that have unique and varied functions. Future Plans and ideas for this mod will be laid out in the TODO portion.
